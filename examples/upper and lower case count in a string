#In Python, when a function returns multiple values, they are returned as a tuple.
#Tuple unpacking allows you to assign each value from the tuple to separate variables in a single line.

#The line a, b = count_upper_lower(text) works because count_upper_lower(text) returns a tuple with two values, and Python automatically assigns those values to a and b through tuple unpacking.
